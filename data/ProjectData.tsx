      'A sophisticated Discord bot powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT, featuring thread-aware memory with automated summarisation, persona-based and fine-tuned modes, rate-limiting cooldowns, emoji-shortcode replacement, inline LaTeX-to-image rendering, comprehensive image/file input parsing, rotating logs, and a Build & Test CI pipeline. Built with TypeScript, Discord.js and Node.js. I made this to make "clones" of my friends but with exaggerated personalities, and they love it, especially the fine-tuned models.',

      'This project was created to determine the most central location for a group to go bowling. Since we lived in different areas, I wanted a tool that could identify the technically most central location for us to meet. It shows both the geographical centre of the group and the "most central" location based on the distances of each person. I plan to work on a version 2 of this project soon, which will include travel times using various transportation methods.',
